## What is WCAG 2.2 and Why Does It Matter?

**WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.2** is the latest iteration of the international standard for web accessibility, published by the W3C in October 2023. It builds upon WCAG 2.1 with 9 additional success criteria specifically designed to address accessibility barriers faced by users with cognitive disabilities and mobile device users.

<!-- Good -->
<img src="chart.png" alt="Sales increased 25% from Q1 to Q2">
```

### 2. Insufficient Color Contrast (1.4.3)

**Solution**: Use our [Color Contrast Checker](https://accessibility.build/tools/contrast-checker) to verify ratios

### 3. Missing Form Labels (3.3.2)
**Problem**: Form inputs without proper labels
**Solution**:
```html
<!-- Bad -->
<input type="email" placeholder="Enter email">

<!-- Good -->
<label for="email">Email Address</label>
<input type="email" id="email" placeholder="Enter email">
```

### 4. Improper Heading Structure (1.3.1)
**Problem**: Skipping heading levels or incorrect hierarchy
**Solution**: Use our [Heading Structure Analyzer](https://accessibility.build/tools/heading-analyzer)
